// Image is one image in a conversation: the bytes a model is shown, plus the
// identity that lets a log refer to them without carrying them.
//
// The bytes are deliberately not serialised. A session log is JSON Lines
// precisely so it can be tailed while a run is going and survive a crash
// mid-line; a megabyte of base64 on one line defeats both, and the arcade-style
// caller that caches its session directory between runs would be caching
// screenshots. So a record keeps the digest and the shape, the recorder writes
// the bytes to a blob beside the log, and a resumed run rehydrates by digest.
//
// Digest is the identity rather than the path: the same screenshot read twice
// stores once, and a record can never disagree with the bytes it names.

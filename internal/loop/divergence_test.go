// Cases the corpus could not carry, and what replaced them.
//
// The corpus is the guarantee that this package answers as the implementation
// it was ported from did, so anything the capture had to leave out is a hole in
// that guarantee. A hole nobody wrote down is indistinguishable from a case
// that was simply forgotten - which is why these are enumerated here, each
// naming the hand-written test that took its place, and why the suite checks
// that test still exists.

// notPortable is a captured case that cannot be expressed as corpus data.

	// ID is the record it would have been, kept so a future capture can tell
	// this case was considered rather than missed.

	// Why explains what made it uncapturable and what the replacement asserts.

// notPortableCases is the complete set for this package.
//
// All three are the same hazard. A value containing a reference cycle. JSON has
// no way to express one, so they could not be seeded - but the question
// survives the port, because a malformed payload from a provider must not be
// the thing that aborts a run. A cycle check that panics is worse than no cycle
// check.

			"hazard on this path - marshaling a cycle returns an error rather than recursing " +
			"forever - but the underlying question still applies: does a malformed tool result " +

			"check answers instead of panicking.",

			"heuristic rather than the suffix one. Hand-written for the same reason: the input " +

		ID:          "hasRepeatedResultRun/a5c8fa462b6e#1",

			"still willing to answer after meeting one. Covered by the same replacement, which " +
			"pushes the cyclic result twice and asserts both calls return rather than hang.",

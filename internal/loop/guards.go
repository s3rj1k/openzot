	// spread over four hours - each one recovered from, each one followed by
	// real work - left the run with no budget at all, and the twenty-first
	// blip ended it however healthy it was. The bound is meant to catch a run
	// that cannot get going again, so it asks that question and no other: it
	// zeroes the moment a turn comes back whole, exactly like the empty and

	// and the run is stuck. It cannot catch the other shape: one that answers
	// often enough to keep resetting the consecutive count, while the run
	// spends most of its life retrying rather than working. Every good turn
	// says the upstream is fine and the tally says it is not, and without this
	// the tally is never consulted.

	// So the number has to be one a run can actually reach. A healthy run
	// spends recoveries in tens - a truncated answer continued, the occasional
	// 500, a context-limit retry - across an iteration budget that
	// defaults to a thousand. Two hundred is a fifth of that budget spent on
	// recovery instead of progress, which no working provider does. Set high
	// enough not to punish a long, output-heavy run that legitimately
	// continues a lot; low enough that a chronically failing endpoint is
	// called what it is instead of nursed for hours.
	//
	// Deliberately absolute rather than a multiple of MaxContinuations. The two
	// answer unrelated questions, and tying them together means lowering the
	// consecutive bound - the obvious thing to want, to fail fast on a stuck

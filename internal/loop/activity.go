// A tool call and its result, as first-class fields rather than a bag of keys.
//
// The engine used to carry these in a `map[string]any` under a `meta.activity`
// key, inherited from a hosted API whose messages are a generic envelope: one
// shape that has to carry attachments, ratings, triggers and a dozen other
// things zot has no concept of. zot has exactly one thing to put there - a tool
// call - and a map buys nothing for it: every read is a type assertion that can
// fail silently, a misspelt key is a compile-time success and a runtime no-op,
// and nothing tells you which keys are expected.
//
// So it is a struct. A missing field is a compile error, the shape is the
// documentation, and the pairing and rendering code stops guessing.

// ToolResult is what a handler returns when a tool produces more than text.
//
// A handler's return value is `any`, and text or a JSON-encodable value is
// still the common case; this is the shape for the uncommon one. The images do
// not travel in the tool result itself - the wire rejects that - so the engine
// takes them off the result and attaches them to a message of its own. Text is
// what the model reads as the result, and it has to stand alone: it is what
// remains if the images are dropped from a trimmed history, or if their
// blobs go missing before a resume.

// Package order defines the work order: the document a zot run is dispatched
// from.
//
// zot deliberately takes no prose on the command line. A factory accepts a work
// order, not a conversation - a durable objective, the acceptance criteria that
// define "done", and the constraints the work must hold to. The order is a file
// so it outlives the invocation: it can be edited, committed, re-run, and later
// judged against.
//
// An order is advisory input - what to do - and may therefore live anywhere,
// including the repository being worked on. How the result is judged (quality
// gates) is deliberately not part of the order schema: adjudication belongs to
// the operator's configuration, never to a document the agent can write.

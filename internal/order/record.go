// Record is one completed run of an order, kept in the book's ledger.
//
// Orders are never deleted or marked up when they finish - the file is the
// contract, and mutating it to track state would destroy the thing being
// tracked. Doneness is derived instead: an order is satisfied when the ledger
// holds a record of a successful run of this exact content. Editing the order
// changes its hash, so an edited order stops being satisfied and runs again -
// re-queueing is a diff, exactly like everything else in the book.

// everything needed to check it - its own closing summary, how many rounds and
// tool calls it took - so a receipt that omits them is throwing away proof it
// was handed. None of it is computed here: every field is copied from what the
// run recorded, which is what keeps a receipt evidence rather than a claim.

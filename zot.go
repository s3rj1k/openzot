// Package zot is the embeddable core of the zot automated software factory. It
// turns a work order - a durable objective, rendered to a task - into an
// agentic run - plan, act, observe, exit - and renders the run in a read-only
// terminal UI.
//
// The agentic loop is zot's own (see the agent package): thread assembly,
// context trimming, loop detection and the tool-call cycle all run locally, against
// any OpenAI-compatible provider. zot needs no account and no hosted engine.
//
// The standalone binary is cmd/zot; an embedding program can import this package
// and call Run directly while zot's internals stay internal.

This is a non-interactive session running in the background. No one is watching, and no questions or further guidance can be answered - you will receive NO further input. Complete the assigned task end to end on your own, using your tools.

Your tools:
- "tasks": list the tasks the work needs and keep each one's status current. Every call carries the whole list, so use it to lay the work out before you start and to revise it whenever your approach changes.
- "shell": your only way to act on the machine, so use it for everything. Read files with cat, head, tail, sed -n 'START,ENDp' and grep -n; list directories with ls and find; create and change files with heredocs, tee, sed -i, patch or a small script; run builds, tests, linters and any other non-interactive command. Never run interactive or long-lived commands.

Operating rules:
- Begin by calling "tasks" to list the concrete tasks the work needs, in the order you will do them.
- Look before you change. Read the code you are about to touch, and read large files in ranges or filter them with grep, because a command's output is truncated at a size limit. After you change anything, build and run the tests, and fix what you broke.
- Write files with a quoted heredoc (<<'EOF') so the shell does not expand what you wrote, and check the result afterwards with cat, sed -n or git diff.
- Keep "tasks" current: mark a task in_progress when you begin it and done when it is finished, and mark it blocked, with a note saying why, when it cannot go on.
- Act, do not narrate. The deliverable is the changed working tree, not an explanation of it; there is no reader to address. Do not pause to summarise, interpret, or analyse tool output - keep working, and use "tasks" for status.`

// nonInteractiveContract is the half no configuration may leave out. Every
// other prompt rule is a preference; this one is a fact about the machine the
// agent is running on. zot has no input channel at all - a run is a work order,
// a provider and a read-only viewer - so an agent that asks a question is not
// answered tersely, it is not answered at all: it waits until a guard kills the
// run, and everything it had not yet written is lost. That failure is silent
// and expensive, and it costs a whole run to discover, so the contract is
// re-attached to whatever instructions a run resolves to rather than left to
// whoever wrote them.
//
// It is written to stand alone, naming the terminal tools itself, because the
// custom instructions it may be appended to need not mention them at all.
const nonInteractiveContract = `## Non-interactive contract

Nothing you address to the user is delivered. There is no reader, no reply, and no approval on its way. A question you ask is discarded unheard, and a run that stops to wait for an answer waits until a guard kills it, losing the work it had not yet finished.

- Never stop to wait for input, approval, permission or confirmation. No one can grant what you asked for, so asking and waiting is the one certain way to fail the task.
- Never end your turn with a question, an offer, or a promise to continue once told to. Continue now instead.
- Where the task is ambiguous or underspecified, decide it the way a careful engineer would, act on the decision, and record the assumption in a task's note and again in your final summary. A stated assumption is reviewable afterwards; an unasked question is not.
- Only a terminal tool call ends the task: "success" with a summary when the objective is met, or "failure" with the reason when it genuinely cannot be. Uncertainty is not a reason to stop - it is a reason to choose, act, and say what you chose. Do not simply stop.`

// taskHeading introduces the task inside the instructions. The task lives in the

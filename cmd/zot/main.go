// Command zot is an automated software factory you watch, not drive.
//
// zot takes work orders, not prompts. A work order is a small YAML file - the
// durable objective, the acceptance criteria that define "done", the
// constraints the work must hold to - and each order becomes one autonomous
// run: the agent reads files, edits them, and runs shell commands on its own
// while the terminal streams a live, read-only view of everything it does.
//
// Usage:
//
//	# declare a provider (base_url, api_key), a default_provider and agent.model
//	zot config
//
//	# write an order, then run it - orders and their records live under .zot/
//	zot new "add a /health endpoint to the Go server and a test for it"
//	zot
//
//	# a bare zot runs the whole book, in filename order, skipping what the
//	# ledger already records as done; naming orders runs exactly those
//	zot .zot/orders/add-a-health-endpoint-to-the-go-server-and-a-te.yaml
//
//	# every run is logged; pick one up where it stopped, or export one
//	zot sessions
//	zot --resume last
//	zot sessions export last --out ./trajectories

zot takes work orders, not prompts. A work order is a small YAML file: the
durable objective, the acceptance criteria that define "done", and the
constraints the work must hold to. Each order is one autonomous run.

Usage:
  zot [flags] [<order.yaml> ...]
  zot new [--draft] [--dir <dir>] [--orders-dir <dir>] ["the objective"]
  zot config
  zot sessions
  zot --watch [<folder-or-glob>]

Examples:
  zot
  zot new "add input validation to the signup handler and a test"
  zot new --draft "add rate limiting to the API"
  zot new --dir ~/work/api "fix the flaky test"
  zot new --orders-dir ~/briefs "fix the flaky test"
  zot .zot/orders/add-input-validation-to-the-signup-handler-and.yaml
  zot --dir ./scratch .zot/orders/*.yaml
  zot --resume last

The book: a project keeps its orders and the record of what has been run from
them under .zot in its root - .zot/orders/<slug>.yaml written by zot new, and
.zot/records/<slug>/<run>.yaml written by a successful run. Bare zot runs
that book: every order in it, in filename order, with the ledger deciding which
are still outstanding - so writing an order and typing zot is the whole loop.
Naming order files instead runs exactly those, read from any path in any tree;
running an order needs no book at all.

Both halves of the book are yours to move: --orders-dir is where zot new files
an order and where a bare zot looks for work, --records-dir is where the ledger
is written. The ledger defaults to <dir>/.zot/records - the book of the project
being worked on, not one beside whatever order file was named, because the
receipt belongs with the work rather than with the brief.

A batch runs each order as its own run, in sequence, and stops at the first
order that does not end in success. A successful run enters the ledger, and a
satisfied order is skipped on the next invocation - editing the order re-queues
it, --rerun forces it. An order whose last run did not conclude is continued
automatically; --fresh starts it from scratch instead.

Watch mode keeps zot up and runs work as it arrives instead of exiting when the
batch ends. Bare zot --watch watches the orders directory; name a folder
(zot --watch ~/inbox) or a glob (zot --watch "~/inbox/*.yaml") to watch that
instead. Every *.yaml that shows up - including orders already sitting there -
runs as its own run, one at a time. The ledger applies, so an order that already
ran is skipped; a failed order is reported and the watch goes on; Ctrl-C stops
watching.

Commands:
  new        scaffold a work order under ./.zot/orders - under <dir>/.zot/orders
             with --dir, or anywhere with --orders-dir. Bare for the blank
             form, with an objective to fill it in, --draft to have the
             configured model propose the acceptance criteria for your review
             (surveying --dir, when given)
  config     edit the config file in $EDITOR (creates it on first run)
  sessions   list previous runs, newest first

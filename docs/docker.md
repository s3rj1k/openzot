# Running zot in a container

zot is an autonomous agent with real file-write and shell-exec access to its
working directory. A container is the most practical way to bound that: the
agent can only change what you mounted, and the usual `docker run` levers
(dropped capabilities, a read-only root filesystem, resource limits) apply
without zot having to implement a sandbox of its own.

This document covers the published image. For the agent itself see the
[README](../README.md); for flags and config see
[configuration.md](configuration.md), and for providers
[providers.md](providers.md).

## The image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Registry | `ghcr.io/openzot/openzot` |
| Tags | `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, and `latest` for stable releases. Prereleases (`v0.5.0-beta.1`) publish only their exact tags and never move `latest`. |
| Platforms | `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` |
| Command | `zot`, which is also the entrypoint |
| Base | `alpine:3.22` plus TLS roots and timezone data |

The published image is deliberately the pure runtime: the zot executable and a
POSIX shell, without Git, ripgrep, compilers, or language toolchains. It is
useful as-is for a mounted workspace whose task needs no extra executable, and
as a base to [layer a toolchain on](#extending-the-image) when one does.

### Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/workspace` | Working directory. Mount your checkout here. |
| `/home/zot/.config/zot/config.yaml` | Config file, pointed at by `ZOT_CONFIG`. Absent by default - mount one that declares a provider. |
| `/usr/local/share/zot/zot.example.yaml` | The documented example config, for copying out. |
| `/usr/local/bin/zot` | The binary. |

`HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` and
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` are all set under `/home/zot`. The image user is `zot`
(uid/gid 10001).

## Running a task

zot talks straight to a model provider, so a run needs nothing but a declared
provider, its key, and a work order under `.zot/orders/` in the mounted
workspace - the image's working directory is `/workspace`, so a bare `zot` there
runs the project's book exactly as it does on the host. zot has no built-in
providers, so the provider and model come from a config file you mount, and
the key from an environment variable that config references:

```yaml
# zot.yaml
default_provider: mygateway
agent:
  model: my-model
providers:
  mygateway:
    base_url: https://gateway.example.com/v1
    api_key: '$GATEWAY_KEY'
```

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env GATEWAY_KEY \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  --volume "$PWD/zot.yaml":/home/zot/.config/zot/config.yaml:ro \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest
```

See [providers.md](providers.md) for the full picture. The examples below leave
the config mount out for brevity; add it to each.

```bash
# write the order - with zot new on the host, or with the image itself
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env HOME=/tmp \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest new "add input validation to the signup handler and a test"

# edit its acceptance criteria, then run the book
docker run --rm -it \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env HOME=/tmp \
  --env GATEWAY_KEY \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest
```

Two flags need explaining, and both are about **bind mounts**, not about zot:

- **`--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`.** A host directory keeps its host ownership
  inside the container, so the default uid 10001 cannot write to a checkout
  owned by you. Running as yourself fixes that in both directions: the agent can
  edit the files, and everything it creates belongs to you afterwards rather
  than to uid 10001.
- **`--env HOME=/tmp`.** `/home/zot` belongs to the image user, so an
  overridden uid has no writable home. Tools that keep state there - `git
  config --global`, an SSH `known_hosts` - fail without this. `/tmp` is
  world-writable and disposable, which is what you want for a one-shot run.

Neither is needed when the workspace is a **named volume**, because Docker
initialises it from the image and the default user owns it:

```bash
# draft the order into the empty volume, then run it
docker run --rm --env GATEWAY_KEY --volume zot-workspace:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest new --draft "scaffold a tiny snake game in python"
docker run --rm -it --env GATEWAY_KEY --volume zot-workspace:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest
```

That is the safest shape available: the run cannot see your filesystem at all.
Retrieve the result with `docker cp`. Seed the volume separately when the task
needs existing source; the lean image does not include Git. (`--draft` has the
model fill in the acceptance criteria, since there is no easy way to edit the
order inside a named volume.)

### Credentials

The provider credential is an environment variable - never bake it into an image
or a config file you push anywhere:

```bash
# pass through a variable already exported in your shell
docker run --env GATEWAY_KEY …

# or from a file the daemon reads at run time
docker run --env-file ./zot.env …
```

Released binaries - the published image included - deliberately do **not** read
a `.env` from the working directory. A container run mounts a checkout it did
not write, and reading credentials out of it would mean a stray committed `.env`
in the code under review could feed the process that is about to run shell
commands. Pass credentials with `--env` or `--env-file`, where the value comes
from your secret store. (A developer build, `make dev`, does read `.env`; see
[release vs developer builds](development.md#release-vs-developer-builds).)

After zot loads its configuration, configured provider credentials are removed
from the environment inherited by agent shell commands, so the task itself
cannot read the key that is paying for it.

Use a key scoped to the narrowest thing that works - a project-scoped provider
key rather than an account-wide one. A container run unattended is exactly the
case the scoping is for.

### Config, `AGENTS.md` and skills

Per-project context needs nothing: `AGENTS.md` and `.skills/` are read from the
working directory, which is the volume you mounted.

Global context lives in the config directory, so mount it read-only:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --env HOME=/tmp \
  --env GATEWAY_KEY \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  --volume "$HOME/.config/zot":/home/zot/.config/zot:ro \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest
```

`ZOT_CONFIG` already points at `/home/zot/.config/zot/config.yaml`; a missing
file there is not an error. Single settings are easier as environment
variables - `ZOT_AGENT_MODEL`, `ZOT_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS`, `ZOT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`
- and they override the file.

### Terminal or not

With `-it` you get the full-screen viewer. Without a TTY zot detects it and
streams plain unstyled output instead, which is what you want from a pipeline:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --env HOME=/tmp \
  --env GATEWAY_KEY \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest --max-iterations 40 .zot/orders/rate-limiting.yaml | tee run.log
```

`--max-iterations` is worth setting explicitly for unattended runs. The default
is deliberately enormous, so it is the tool-call budget and the cycle, empty and
continuation guards - not the iteration count - that actually end a run that has
gone wrong. If you want a hard ceiling on how long a run may go, set this.


## Hardening

The image already runs as a non-root user with no setuid needs. For unattended
runs, add the rest:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --env HOME=/tmp \
  --read-only --tmpfs /tmp \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --pids-limit 512 --memory 2g --cpus 2 \
  --env GATEWAY_KEY \
  --volume "$PWD":/workspace \
  ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:latest .zot/orders/rate-limiting.yaml
```

`--read-only` works because everything zot writes goes to the workspace volume;
the `--tmpfs /tmp` covers `HOME` and whatever the agent's shell commands scratch
down. Note that a read-only root also stops the agent from installing packages
mid-run, which is usually what you want and occasionally the thing that breaks a
task.

**Egress cannot be closed.** The agentic loop runs in the container, but the
model does not, so it needs outbound HTTPS to whichever provider it is
configured against - `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com`, and so on - plus
whatever the task itself fetches. `--network none` gives you a container that
cannot do anything. If you need containment, restrict egress to that one host
rather than removing it.

**The mount is the blast radius.** Mount the narrowest thing that lets the task
succeed - one repository, not a parent directory of every repository. Prefer
`:ro` for anything the agent only needs to read.

## Extending the image

A task that builds Go, installs npm packages, or runs a database client needs
those tools present. Layer them on:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/openzot/openzot:v0.4.1

USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache go nodejs npm make
USER zot
```

Pin the base tag rather than tracking `latest`, so an agent's behaviour does not
change under a build you did not intend.

## Building locally

```bash
make image
docker run --rm openzot/zot:local --version
```

`make image` stamps the version from the `VERSION` file into the binary. When
invoking Docker directly, `--build-arg VERSION=...` controls what `--version`
reports; without it the build produces `dev` and the update check is skipped.
Note that `go.work` is excluded from the build context by `.dockerignore` - a
workspace file someone created locally must not leak into an image build and cap
the toolchain below what `go.mod` requires.

Images are always built without `-tags dev`, so a published image never reads a
`.env` from the directory you mounted. See
[Credentials](#credentials).

Published images are built by
[`release.yaml`](../.github/workflows/release.yaml) on every `v*` tag; CI builds
and smoke-tests the same Dockerfile on every code push. See
[RELEASES.md](../RELEASES.md).

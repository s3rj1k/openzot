zot is an automated software factory in a single ~11 MiB binary. It takes a
work order - an objective, the acceptance criteria that define done, the
constraints to hold - and plans, edits, builds, tests and fixes until the work
is done. No chat loop, no approving each edit, no hosted engine, no telemetry.
It talks straight to any OpenAI-compatible model provider with your own key.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zot.im/install.sh | bash
```

That fetches the latest release for your platform (Linux or macOS, amd64 or
arm64), verifies its checksum, and puts `zot` in `~/.local/bin`. Pin a version
with `ZOT_VERSION=vX.Y.Z`, or change the directory with `ZOT_INSTALL_DIR`.

Prefer to do it by hand? Grab a tarball from the
[releases page](https://github.com/openzot/openzot/releases), pull the
[container image](docs/docker.md) (`ghcr.io/openzot/openzot`), or
[build from source](docs/development.md).

## Use

zot ships no providers and no default model: declare a provider and a model in
the config first (`zot config` opens it from a template), then write an order
and hand it over:

```yaml
# ~/.config/zot/config.yaml
default_provider: mygateway
agent:
  model: my-model
providers:
  mygateway:
    base_url: https://gateway.example.com/v1
    api_key: '$GATEWAY_KEY'
```

```bash
export GATEWAY_KEY="..."
zot new "add input validation to the signup handler and a test"
zot
```

`zot new` writes a small YAML order under `.zot/orders/`; edit its acceptance
criteria, then a bare `zot` runs everything outstanding. `zot --watch` turns
the folder into a drop box. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works - a hosted
service, a gateway, a local server - declare it and pick it with `--provider`;
see [providers](docs/providers.md).

## Why Zot

- **Orders, not prompts.** Files that queue, batch and stream. [→ work orders](docs/orders.md)
- **Nothing in the way.** Your key, your provider, your machine. [→ philosophy](docs/philosophy.md)
- **Built to run unattended.** Context trimming, loop detection, resumable logs. [→ how it works](docs/how-it-works.md)
- **Orchestration is content.** No sub-agent framework; skills decide. [→ sub-agents](docs/how-it-works.md#sub-agents-and-coordination)

Watch it work: [the factories](#factories) run in public, each shipping from
one standing order with no human in the loop.

## ⚠️ Safety

zot has real file-write and shell access from `--dir`, and `--dir` is not a
sandbox. Point it at a disposable checkout, or run the
[container image](docs/docker.md). Read [safety](docs/safety.md) first.

## Factories

Live zot factories: the same standing order every 30 minutes, the catalogue as
the only memory, nobody in the loop. The site is the working tree, and every
session ships to a public dataset.

| Factory | Makes | Repo | Sessions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Arcade](https://openzot.github.io/arcade/) | One brand-new browser game per shift, playtested and published | [openzot/arcade](https://github.com/openzot/arcade) | [openzot/arcade](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openzot/arcade) |
| [Machinery](https://openzot.github.io/machinery/) | One working control panel per shift - a live simulation, faults, and its operating manual | [openzot/machinery](https://github.com/openzot/machinery) | [openzot/machinery](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openzot/machinery) |
| [Whetstone](https://openzot.github.io/whetstone/) | One game honed toward perfection - each shift improves one facet and ships the next playable version | [openzot/whetstone](https://github.com/openzot/whetstone) | [openzot/whetstone](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openzot/whetstone) |

## Status

zot is **0.x** and in active use. Flags, config and behavior may change before
1.0 - pin a version and skim the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.
Small, focused pull requests are welcome; anything large is worth an issue first.
